It has been modified to work with Bootstrap 4. The reason this repository exists is because some applications are choosing (or are forced to chose) to stap with Angular 1, but would like to move to Bootstrap 4. (Especially considering the fact that [bootstrap 3 is EoL](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20631).)\n\nThis for makes as few changes as possible to the original source code, so that upstream changes can be merged in with minimal issues. Some work has been used from other attempts to do the same thing, such as the fork from [dietergeerts][].\n\n[dietergeerts]: https://github.com/dietergeerts/bootstrap\n[ui-bootstrap4]: https://github.com/morgul/ui-bootstrap4\n\n## Help Wanted\n\nI did this for a work project, and, frankly, we've gotten what we needed out of it. I'd love to see this cleaned up and maybe even maintained... but I just don't have the time myself. I'll accept merge requests, and fight with the build system... but that's basically it. If someone would like to step in, just let me know and I'll add you to the project. Just open an issue, and I'll respond.\n\nWanting to contribute, but not take over the reigns? The things that are really holding this project back are, as I can see it:\n\n* [ ] Undocumented/confusing build system.\n    * [ ] The whole `SNAPSHOT` thing seems like it adds a lot of complexity, for very little gain.\n    * [ ] Making a release should be a single `npm` command\n    * [ ] Getting started with development should be very simple\n* [ ] Switch to ES2015\n    * [ ] The code should be cleaned up, and better formatted\n    \nI'll add more as I think of them / have the time.\n\n## Quick links\n- [Demo](#demo)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n    - [NPM](#install-with-npm)\n    - [Custom](#custom-build)\n    - [Manual](#manual-download)\n- [Webpack / JSPM](#webpack--jspm)\n- [Support](#support)\n    - [FAQ](#faq)\n    - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n    - [Supported browsers](#supported-browsers)\n    - [Need help?](#need-help)\n    - [Found a bug?](#found-a-bug)\n- [Contributing to the project](#contributing-to-the-project)\n- [Development, meeting minutes, roadmap and more.](#development-meeting-minutes-roadmap-and-more)\n\n\n## Demo\n\nDo you want to see directives in action? Visit https://morgul.github.io/ui-bootstrap4/!\n\n## Installation\n\nInstallation is easy as UI Bootstrap has minimal dependencies - only the AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap's CSS are required.\n*Notes:*\n* Since version 0.13.0, UI Bootstrap depends on [ngAnimate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) for transitions and animations, such as the accordion, carousel, etc. Include `ngAnimate` in the module dependencies for your app in order to enable animation.\n* UI Bootstrap depends on [ngTouch](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngTouch) for swipe actions. Include `ngTouch` in the module dependencies for your app in order to enable swiping.\n\n### Angular Requirements\n* UI Bootstrap 1.0 and higher _requires_ Angular 1.4.x or higher and it has been tested with Angular 1.4.8.\n* UI Bootstrap 0.14.3 is the _last_ version that supports Angular 1.3.x.\n* UI Bootstrap 0.12.0 is the _last_ version that supports Angular 1.2.x.\n\n### Bootstrap Requirements\n* UI Bootstrap 3.0 and higher requires Bootstrap CSS version 4.x or higher and it has been tested with Bootstrap CSS 4.0.0-beta.\n* UI Bootstrap 2.x requires Bootstrap CSS version 3.x or higher and it has been tested with Bootstrap CSS 3.3.6.\n* UI Bootstrap 0.8 is the _last_ version that supports Bootstrap CSS 2.3.x.\n\n#### Install with NPM\n\n```sh\n$ npm install ui-bootstrap4\n```\n\n#### Install with Yarn\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add ui-bootstrap4\n```\n\nThis will install AngularJS and Bootstrap NPM packages.\n\n#### Custom build\n\nHead over to https://morgul.github.io/ui-bootstrap4/ and hit the *Custom build* button to create your own custom UI Bootstrap build, just the way you like it.\n\n#### Manual download\n\nAfter downloading dependencies (or better yet, referencing them from your favorite CDN) you need to download build version of this project. All the files and their purposes are described here:\nhttps://github.com/morgul/ui-bootstrap4/tree/gh-pages#build-files\nDon't worry, if you are not sure which file to take, opt for `ui-bootstrap-tpls-[version].min.js`.\n\n### Adding dependency to your project\n\nWhen you are done downloading all the dependencies and project files the only remaining part is to add dependencies on the `ui.bootstrap` AngularJS module:\n\n```js\nangular.module('myModule', ['ui.bootstrap']);\n```\n\n## Webpack / JSPM\n\nTo use this project with webpack, follow the [NPM](#install-with-npm) instructions.\nNow, if you want to use only the accordion, you can do:\n\n```js\nimport accordion from 'ui-bootstrap4/src/accordion';\n\nangular.module('myModule', [accordion]);\n```\n\nYou can import all the pieces you need in the same way:\n\n```js\nimport accordion from 'ui-bootstrap4/src/accordion';\nimport datepicker from 'ui-bootstrap4/src/datepicker';\n\nangular.module('myModule', [accordion, datepicker]);\n```\n\nThis will load all the dependencies (if any) and also the templates (if any).\n\nBe sure to have a loader able to process `css` files like `css-loader`.\n\nIf you would prefer not to load your css through your JavaScript file loader/bundler, you can choose to import the `index-nocss.js` file instead, which is available for the modules:\n* carousel\n* datepicker\n* datepickerPopup\n* dropdown\n* modal\n* popover\n* position\n* timepicker\n* tooltip\n* typeahead\n\nThe other modules, such as `accordion` in the example below, do not have CSS resources to load, so you should continue to import them as normal:\n\n```js\nimport accordion from 'ui-bootstrap4/src/accordion';\nimport typeahead from 'ui-bootstrap4/src/typeahead/index-nocss.js';\n\nangular.module('myModule', [accordion, typeahead]);\n```\n\n## Versioning\n\nPre-2.0.0 does not follow a particular versioning system. 2.0.0 and onwards follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). All release changes can be viewed on our [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Support\n\n### FAQ\n\nhttps://github.com/morgul/ui-bootstrap4/wiki/FAQ\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nTake a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n### Supported browsers\n\nDirectives from this repository are automatically tested with the following browsers:\n* Chrome (stable and canary channel)\n* Firefox\n* IE 9 and 10\n* Opera\n* Safari\n\nModern mobile browsers should work without problems.\n\n## Need help?\nNeed help using UI Bootstrap?\n\n* ~~Live help in the IRC (`#angularjs` channel at the `freenode` network). Use this [webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/) or your own IRC client.~~\n* ~~Ask a question in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) under the [ui-bootstrap4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ui-bootstrap4) tag.~~\n\n**For now, please create new issues in this repository to ask questions about using UI Bootstrap 4**\n\n## Found a bug?\nPlease take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#you-think-youve-found-a-bug) and submit your issue [here](https://github.com/morgul/ui-bootstrap4/issues/new).\n\n\n----\n\n\n## Contributing to the project\n\nWe are always looking for the quality contributions! Please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution guidelines.\n\n~~## Development, meeting minutes, roadmap and more.~~\n\n~~Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/morgul/ui-bootstrap4/wiki) for notes on development for UI Bootstrap, meeting minutes from the UI Bootstrap team, roadmap plans, project philosophy and more.~~\n\n----\n\n## Building a Release\n\nI've currently hacked out a solution, but the whole thing's very messy. For now, to build a release, just do:\n\n```\n$ grunt release:3.0.0\n```\n\n(Obviously, replace `3.0.0` with the version you're releasing.) That should build a correct release, and update the \ndocs, and everything.\n",
